# Type Casting
Type casting is a way to check the type of an instance, or to treat that instance as a different superclass or subclass from somewhere else in its own class hierarchy.

Type casting in Swift is implemented with the is and as operators. These two operators provide a simple and expressive way to check the type of a value or cast a value to a different type.

# Defining a Class Hierarchy for Type Casting
You can use type casting with a hierarchy of classes and subclasses to check the type of a particular class instance and to cast that instance to another class within the same hierarchy. 
The three code snippets below define a hierarchy of classes and an array containing instances of those classes, for use in an example of type casting.
The first snippet defines a new base class called MediaItem. This class provides basic functionality for any kind of item that appears in a digital media library. 
Specifically, it declares a name property of type String, and an init name initializer. (It is assumed that all media items, including all movies and songs, will have a name.)
