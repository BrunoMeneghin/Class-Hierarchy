# Class-Hierarchy

*Defining a Class Hierarchy for Type Casting*

You can use type casting with a hierarchy of classes and subclasses to check the type of a particular class instance and to cast that instance to another class within the same hierarchy. 
The three code snippets below define a hierarchy of classes and an array containing instances of those classes, for use in an example of type casting.
The first snippet defines a new base class called MediaItem. This class provides basic functionality for any kind of item that appears in a digital media library. 
Specifically, it declares a name property of type String, and an init name initializer. (It is assumed that all media items, including all movies and songs, will have a name.)
